# Home Assistant Add-on

BLE Scale Sync ships as a native Home Assistant add-on for Home Assistant OS and Supervised installations. The add-on generates a working config from the UI, auto-detects the Mosquitto broker, exposes every metric as an MQTT auto-discovery sensor, and can optionally upload to Garmin Connect.

## Install

[![Add BLE Scale Sync repository to your Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FKristianP26%2Fble-scale-sync)

The badge above uses [My Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/my/) to open your instance, confirm the repository, and drop you on the Add-on Store with **BLE Scale Sync** visible. Click **Install**, then head to the **Configuration** tab and fill in your scale MAC and user profile. Start the add-on from the **Info** tab. The Supervisor pulls the arm64 / armv7 / amd64 image to match your host.

::: details Prefer manual steps?

1. **Settings** > **Add-ons** > **Add-on Store**.
2. Three-dot menu > **Repositories** and add:

   ```
   https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync
   ```

3. Refresh the store. **BLE Scale Sync** appears under the new repository.
4. Click **Install**, then open the **Configuration** tab and fill in your scale MAC and user profile. Start the add-on from the **Info** tab.
   :::

::: tip
The add-on requires `host_network`, `host_dbus`, and the `NET_ADMIN` / `NET_RAW` capabilities to access the host Bluetooth adapter through BlueZ. The Supervisor grants these automatically. The add-on also declares `apparmor: false`, because the Supervisor's default AppArmor profile blocks the D-Bus handshake that BlueZ needs. See [#271](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/issues/271).

## Quick start

Minimal config for a single-user Renpho / Xiaomi / Eufy scale with MQTT and Home Assistant auto-discovery:

1. Install the **Mosquitto broker** add-on (if you do not already run an MQTT broker) and start it.
2. In the BLE Scale Sync config:
   - Leave **Scale MAC address** empty for auto-discovery, or paste the MAC you found with the `scan` command.
   - Fill **User profile** (name, height, birth date, gender).
   - Leave **MQTT enabled** and **MQTT auto-detect** on. The add-on reads the Mosquitto broker details from the Supervisor API, so no broker URL or credentials are needed.
3. Start the add-on and step on the scale. Within a few minutes new sensors appear under **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **MQTT**.

The exposed sensors cover weight, body fat, water, muscle mass, bone mass, BMI, BMR, visceral fat, metabolic age, and impedance.

## Configuration reference

All options live under the **Configuration** tab. The add-on regenerates `/data/config.yaml` on every restart, so changes here take effect on the next start.

### Scale and BLE

| Option                       | Default              | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scale_mac`                  | empty                | Leave empty for auto-discovery. Set to a specific MAC like `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` to skip scanning. Required for scales with non-unique advertised names.                                                                              |
| `ble_adapter`                | empty (uses default) | Set to `hci0`, `hci1`, ... on hosts with multiple Bluetooth adapters.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `reset_bluetooth`            | `true`               | Runs `btmgmt power off/on` at startup. Leave on unless you run other HA Bluetooth integrations that lose connectivity when the adapter is power-cycled.                                                                             |
| `force_scale_adapter`        | empty                | Overrides protocol auto-detection with the adapter name exactly as printed in the `Adapters:` line in the log. Requires `scale_mac`, because a forced adapter claims every device it is shown. Please also report the misdetection. |
| `qn_protocol_byte`           | empty                | QN-family scales only. The protocol byte the handshake echoes back, 0 to 255. Set it only when a QN scale completes the whole handshake in the log and then never reports a weight.                                                 |
| `qn_report_byte`             | empty                | QN-family scales only, worth trying after `qn_protocol_byte` did not help. Payload byte of the history-response frame, 0 to 255. The default depends on the dialect: `252` on the long-frame ones (es26m and extended) and `254` on the classic one. Try the other value if your scale completes the handshake and then reports nothing.  |
| `auto_clear_stale_bond`      | `false`              | Bonded scales only (Beurer BF7xx / BF9xx). Delete a pairing key the scale has forgotten and pair again, instead of failing every connect until `bluetoothctl remove` is run by hand.                                                |
| `qn_weight_ack`              | unset                | QN-family scales only. Answer every live weight frame with its own weight, as the vendor app does. Try `true` if your QN scale completes the handshake and then reports nothing.                                                    |
| `qn_a4_prelude`              | unset                | QN-family scales only, and the last thing to try. Sends the two undecoded `0xA4` frames an Arboleaf vendor app sends between START and the first weight frame. Set `true` only if `qn_weight_ack` did not help.                     |
| `qn_time_sync_long`          | unset                | QN-family scales only. Sends the 9-byte form of the clock-setting frame the same Arboleaf capture shows, instead of the 8-byte one. The extra byte is undecoded.                                                                    |
| `qn_config_long`             | unset                | QN-family scales only, and the last difference anyone has found between our start-up conversation and the vendor app's. Sends the 10-byte form of the settings frame instead of the 9-byte one. The extra bytes are undecoded.      |
| `display_unit`               | `weight_unit`        | Unit requested on the physical display independently of exported values. `st` currently affects QN-family scales that support stones.                                                   |
| `proxy_liveness_timeout_min` | `30`                 | Proxy transports only. Minutes of total advertisement silence before the link is treated as wedged and the add-on restarts. 0 disables. Raise it if your proxy sits somewhere with no other Bluetooth devices in range.             |

The QN options and `auto_clear_stale_bond` are ignored when `custom_config` is enabled, since that mode skips config generation entirely; set them in the corresponding `ble:` or `scale:` section of your own file instead. The add-on logs a warning if you leave one set.

### Unit preferences

| Option        | Default | Allowed     |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `weight_unit` | `kg`    | `kg`, `lbs` |
| `height_unit` | `cm`    | `cm`, `in`  |
| `display_unit` | `weight_unit` | `weight_unit`, `kg`, `lbs`, `st` |

The CLI and exporters display weights and heights in your chosen unit; all internal math stays in kg / cm. `display_unit` controls the physical scale separately, where the protocol supports it. For example, `weight_unit: kg` with `display_unit: st` keeps Home Assistant values in kg while asking a compatible QN scale to display stones and pounds.

### User profile

| Option                                | Default      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `user_name`                           | `Default`    | Display name used in logs and HA entity names.                                                                                                                                             |
| `user_height`                         | `170`        | In the unit chosen above.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `user_birth_date`                     | `1990-01-01` | `YYYY-MM-DD`. Used for age-based BMR and physique rating.                                                                                                                                  |
| `user_gender`                         | `male`       | `male` or `female`.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `user_is_athlete`                     | `false`      | Shifts body fat formulas for athletic body types.                                                                                                                                          |
| `user_weight_min` / `user_weight_max` | `40` / `150` | The plausible weight range for this person, in kg. On its own it only warns; set `out_of_range` below to `skip` to have readings outside it discarded.                                     |
| `out_of_range`                        | `warn`       | What to do with a reading outside that range. `warn` logs it and exports anyway (the behaviour before this option existed). `skip` logs it and stops: no export, and the remembered weight is left alone. |

### MQTT

| Option                            | Default                  | Notes                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mqtt_enabled`                    | `true`                   | Enable the MQTT exporter.                                                                                                                  |
| `mqtt_auto`                       | `true`                   | Auto-detect the Mosquitto add-on broker via the Supervisor API. Overrides manual URL / credentials when the Mosquitto add-on is installed. |
| `mqtt_broker_url`                 | empty                    | Manual broker URL, e.g. `mqtt://192.168.1.50:1883` or `mqtts://...`. Only used when `mqtt_auto` is off or auto-detection fails.            |
| `mqtt_username` / `mqtt_password` | empty                    | Credentials for the manual broker.                                                                                                         |
| `mqtt_topic`                      | `scale/body-composition` | Base topic. Payload is published to this topic; HA discovery entities use `homeassistant/sensor/<topic>/...`.                              |
| `mqtt_ha_discovery`               | `true`                   | Publish auto-discovery entities under `homeassistant/`. Disable if you want raw MQTT only.                                                 |
| `mqtt_ha_device_name`             | `BLE Scale`              | Device name grouping the entities in HA.                                                                                                   |

### Garmin Connect

| Option                             | Default | Notes                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `garmin_enabled`                   | `false` | Enable the Garmin Connect exporter.                                                                                                    |
| `garmin_email` / `garmin_password` | empty   | Garmin credentials. On first start the add-on runs `setup_garmin.py` to authenticate and saves OAuth tokens to `/data/garmin-tokens/`. |
| `garmin_weight_only`               | `false` | Upload the weight alone; BMI, body fat, water, bone, muscle, visceral fat, physique rating and metabolic age are left unset in Garmin. |
| `garmin_upload_timeout_sec`        | `180`   | Seconds one Garmin upload attempt may take before it is killed (10-900). Three attempts are made. Raise it if uploads time out for a measurement that uploads fine later. |

If your account uses MFA, see [MFA workaround](#mfa-workaround) below.

### Runtime

| Option          | Default | Notes                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scan_cooldown` | `30`    | Seconds to wait after a successful reading before scanning again. Range: 5-3600.                                                         |
| `idle_rescan_delay`                | `5`     | Seconds to wait before scanning again after a cycle that found no scale while the adapter was healthy. Range: 0-3600. Real failures keep their own backoff. |
| `retry_failed_exports`             | `true`  | Keep a reading whose upload failed and retry it later, up to 72 hours. Only targets that can record a past measurement are retried; MQTT and notifications cannot. The queue lives in `/data`, which survives add-on restarts and updates. |
| `debug`         | `false` | Enable verbose BLE logs. Useful when opening an issue.                                                                         |
| `custom_config` | `false` | Ignore UI options entirely and use `/share/ble-scale-sync/config.yaml` instead. See [Custom config mode](#custom-config-mode). |

## MQTT auto-detection

When `mqtt_auto: true` and the Mosquitto add-on is running on the same host, BLE Scale Sync pulls the broker URL, username, and password from the Supervisor API (`GET /services/mqtt`) and wires the MQTT exporter automatically. You will see a line like this in the logs:

```
[ble-scale-sync] MQTT auto-detected: mqtt://core-mosquitto:1883
```

If the Mosquitto add-on is not installed or the API call fails, the add-on falls back to whatever you set in `mqtt_broker_url` / `mqtt_username` / `mqtt_password`.

## Garmin Connect

To upload measurements to Garmin Connect:

1. Enable **Garmin Connect** and enter your email and password in the Configuration tab.
2. Start the add-on.
3. On first start the add-on runs `python3 garmin-scripts/setup_garmin.py --from-config /data/config.yaml`. If authentication succeeds, OAuth tokens are saved under `/data/garmin-tokens/` and subsequent runs reuse them without re-entering the password.

### MFA workaround

Home Assistant add-ons run without an interactive terminal, so the add-on cannot prompt for a 2FA code. If your account has MFA enabled:

1. On a laptop or desktop, clone the repo and run `python3 garmin-scripts/setup_garmin.py`. Enter email, password, and MFA code when prompted. This writes `garmin_tokens.json` to `~/.garmin_tokens/`.
2. Copy that file to `/share/ble-scale-sync/garmin-tokens/` on the Home Assistant host. The Samba and File editor add-ons both expose `/share/` for easy uploads.
3. Restart BLE Scale Sync. On startup the add-on detects the pre-generated token and imports it into `/data/garmin-tokens/`.

The same workflow applies if Garmin is blocking your HA host's IP as a data-centre / VPN address: authenticate from a trusted network and import the tokens.

## Custom config mode

For multi-user setups or exporters the UI does not cover (InfluxDB, Webhook, Ntfy, Strava, File), flip `custom_config: true` and drop a full `config.yaml` at:

```
/share/ble-scale-sync/config.yaml
```

The add-on copies that file verbatim into the runtime location on each start. See [config.yaml.example](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/blob/main/config.yaml.example) for the full schema.

::: warning Editing it needs a restart
The copy happens once, at startup. The config watcher that picks up live edits watches the runtime copy, not the file under `/share/`, so editing `/share/ble-scale-sync/config.yaml` while the add-on is running changes nothing until you restart it.
:::

Custom config mode still benefits from `last_known_weight` persistence (see below) but the add-on does not auto-run Garmin authentication; you handle that yourself by pre-seeding `/share/ble-scale-sync/garmin-tokens/`.

## Testing a development build

Fixes land on the `dev` branch before they are released, and maintainers often ask reporters to retest there. What that means for the add-on is not obvious, so it is spelled out here.

The Supervisor accepts a branch in the repository URL:

```
https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync#dev
```

::: warning That gives you the dev add-on wrapper, not dev application code
The add-on is a thin layer over a published application image, and `build.yaml` pins that image to the last **release** on both branches. So a `#dev` install gives you the dev branch's options UI and `run.sh`, running the released application underneath.

This is exactly the trap in [#318](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/issues/318): a new option appeared in the UI, was set, and did nothing, because the application inside the container predated it.
:::

To actually run unreleased application code today, run the plain Docker image outside the Supervisor:

```
ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:dev
```

Every push to `dev` publishes that tag, plus an immutable `dev-<sha>` tag if you need two machines on provably the same build. See [Docker deployment](/guide/getting-started#docker) for the flags. You lose Supervisor integration and MQTT auto-detection; you gain the code under test.

When reporting back, paste the `Version` line from the top of the log. On an image build it names the channel and the commit:

```
[Sync] Version 1.22.1 (image dev @ 9c67525)
```

## Persistence

Everything that should survive add-on restarts lives under `/data/` inside the container, which the Supervisor maps to persistent storage:

| Path                   | Purpose                                                                                                             |

## Troubleshooting

### No scale found

1. Step on the scale to wake it up. Most scales go to sleep after a few seconds.
2. Run the **scan** command from a terminal on the HA host:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it --network host --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_RAW \
     --group-add "$(getent group bluetooth | cut -d: -f3)" -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus:ro \
     --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
     ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:latest scan
   ```

   On hosts whose Docker applies a restrictive default AppArmor policy, dropping `--security-opt apparmor=unconfined` makes this command exit with `DBusError` and `AccessDenied`. See [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting#docker-issues).

3. If the scale is visible, paste its MAC into the **Scale MAC address** field.
4. If multiple Bluetooth adapters are attached, set **BLE adapter** to the one facing the scale (`hci1`, etc.).

### MQTT entities do not appear

1. Open the Mosquitto add-on logs and confirm it is running and accepting connections.
2. Enable `debug: true` in the BLE Scale Sync add-on and restart. Look for `[ble-scale-sync] MQTT auto-detected: ...` at startup.
3. Check that the scale actually produced a measurement; HA auto-discovery entities are published on the first successful reading.

### Garmin "No such file or directory: oauth1_token.json"

Fixed in v1.7.5. Make sure the add-on is on that version or newer. If it still fails, your account likely uses MFA. See [MFA workaround](#mfa-workaround).

### Garmin "'Garmin' object has no attribute 'garth'"

Fixed in v1.8.1. The `garminconnect` library released 0.3.0 on 2026-04-02 which removed the `garth` attribute. The add-on now uses the new native auth API and automatically strips incompatible legacy token files on startup, then re-authenticates from the credentials you entered. If you still see this error, upgrade to v1.8.1 or newer and restart the add-on. MFA users also need to regenerate the MFA token (single `garmin_tokens.json` file now, no more `oauth1/oauth2_token.json`).

### BlueZ discovery gets stuck after hours

Known upstream BlueZ bug on Broadcom adapters (`bluez/bluez#807`). See the general [troubleshooting page](/troubleshooting#ble-discovery-stops-working-after-hours-bluez-stuck-state) for the full recovery behaviour the app implements. The add-on already has `/dev/rfkill` and `CAP_NET_ADMIN` available for the recovery tiers.

## Limitations and roadmap

- The UI is scoped to a single user. For multi-user / per-user-exporter setups, use [custom config mode](#custom-config-mode).
- The add-on has not yet been submitted to the [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) default repository. For now, add the GitHub URL as a custom repository.
- A dedicated Home Assistant notification exporter (persistent notifications or Companion app push) is planned.

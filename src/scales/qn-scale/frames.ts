 * of this app in the same session:
 *
 *   vendor app       20 09 ff f3 b3 22 32 08 2a     9 bytes
 *   ble-scale-sync   20 08 ff a1 aa 22 32 c6        8 bytes
 *
 * Both close under the family's sum-of-preceding-bytes checksum (0x2a and 0xc6),
 * `[1]` is the total frame length in both, and `[3..6]` little-endian is seconds
 * since 2000-01-01 in both, 2386 s apart on the capture day. So the timestamp
 * field, its position and the checksum rule are identical and the entire
 * difference is this one byte before the checksum.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEANS IS NOT DECODED. That is why `ble.qn_time_sync_long` is off by
 * default: a wrong value here is silent in exactly the way `qn_protocol_byte`
 * is, and every QN scale in the registry reads today on the 8-byte form.
 *
 * The app's 0x13 config frame is likewise one byte longer than ours. That one
 * lives in `buildConfig` below, behind its own switch for the same reason: two
 * frames moving at once makes a reporter's result unreadable.

 * miscount. `[1]` is the total frame length in all three, and bytes `[0..6]`
 * are identical, so the entire difference is the pair at `[7..8]`.
 *

   *   - `onConnected` pre-empts the legacy unlock, so an `Unlockable` adapter

   *
   * Adapters are shared singletons. Without this an adapter cannot tell a fresh
   * weigh-in from the previous one, and a stale cached weight or completeness
   * flag lets the next session resolve on the last person's data.
   *
   * It clears GATING state safely, but it is NOT a safe place to clear state a
   * previous reading's `computeMetrics` still needs. Session N+1's
   * `onSessionStart` is not ordered after session N's `computeMetrics`: on the
   * watcher transports the watcher keeps running while `loop.ts` awaits
   * `processReading()` (network exports included) and can open the next GATT
   * session in the meantime. An adapter that carries composition out of band in
   * its own fields must pin it onto the reading it belongs to, taking the
   * snapshot at emit time, rather than read the live cache in `computeMetrics`.
   * Use `ReadingComposition` from `body-comp-helpers.ts` for that: it owns the
   * `WeakMap` and the reasoning, and `of()` deliberately checks `has()` rather
   * than falling back on a nullish value, so an adapter whose "no composition"
   * state is itself null stays correct. Hand-rolling it is how six copies of
   * the same paragraph drifted apart in type; `beurer-bf720`,
   * `beurer-sanitas`, `hoffen`, `mgb`, `medisana-bs44x` and `senssun` are those
   * copies and are still to be converted.
   *
   * It is a GATT-session hook only. The broadcast path never opens a session,
   * so `parseBroadcast` / `parseServiceData` run without it ever firing. Adding
   * a broadcast parser to an adapter that relies on this reset would silently
   * bypass it; today every such adapter either has no broadcast parser or, like
   * `eufy-p2`, has a stateless one.
   *
   * Must not throw and must not perform I/O: nothing is connected yet. Reading
   * a value the adapter already recorded is fine, which is what the address is
   * for: an adapter that keeps per-device state (yunmai's Mini/SE variant) can
   * resolve it here, for the device this session is about to read, rather than
   * carrying whatever `matches()` last saw.
   *
   * `deviceAddress` is uppercase with no separators, and it is NOT always a
